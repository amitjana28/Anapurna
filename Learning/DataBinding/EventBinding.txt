Event binding is a one way binding from view-to-compnent. We use it to perform an action in the components when the user performs an action like click on button, changing the inputs etc in the view.

Syntex : (target-event)="TemplateStatements"

Example : <button (click)="clickCount()"> Count </button>
          <button on-click="clickCount()"> Count </button>

Multiple Event Handlers : We can also bind an unlimited number of event handlers on the same event by seperating them with a semicolon
    Example : <button on-click="clickMe(); clickCount1=clickCount"> Count </button>

$event Payload :
