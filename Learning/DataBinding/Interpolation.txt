We use Interpolation to bind a componant property, methods or to a template referance variable to the string linteral into the view. It is one way data binding from Componant-to-view.
The expression must result in a string. If it return object it will not work. If we want to bind the expression that is other then a string , then Property binding is best option.
Interpolation and property binding can set only on properties not on attributes.

Exaples of interpolation : 
    Invoking the Componants methods
    Concatinate two strings
    Perform some mathematical operations
    Bind the property of html elements, componant or directives. We can any properties that accets a strings
    Use a template referance variable
    Cross-site scrippting or XSS
    NgNonBindable
    Use pipes
    The safe navigation operator(?)
    The non null assertion operator

Example : 
    app.ts --> Componant files

        export class App{
            title = "My Title"
            fname = "Amit"
            lname = "Jana"
            fullName() {
                return this.fname+this.lname;
            }
        }

    app.html --> Template files
        <h1> {{title}} </h1>
        <p> My Full name is {{fullName()}} </p>
